# Star Utilities
Various utilities for authoring stars with realistic properties in Unity. Includes utility functions and a star shader.

# Dependencies
The shader included in this package depends on the Noisy Nodes package: https://github.com/JimmyCushnie/Noisy-Nodes

The package manager unfortunately does not allow git dependencies for packages, so you will need to install this yourself if you intend to use the included shader.
